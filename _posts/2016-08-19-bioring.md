# BioRing

A groundbreaking ring that ensures you stay on track with your health & wellness goals.

Other wearables like FitBit and Jawbone only measure your calorie burn, without measuring your calorie intake. Knowing both is crucial if you want to lose weight or just live healthy.   
BioRing measures both, giving you a detailed breakdown of the food you are eating and helping you manage your weight - all in a revolutionary small size with sleek Scandinavian design.

BioRing is the next generation of wellness technology.
